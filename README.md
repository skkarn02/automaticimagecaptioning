We as a human being can easily describe what is there in the image by just looking into the picture but can computer do it automatically . Earlier it was impossible to get relevant features from the image and describe it into appropriate words but with the advancement of neural network it is possible to generate a relevant caption from a image.

I will be using Flickr8k dataset which containg 8k images and relevant caption about that particular image which can be easily downloaded by following this link. https://machinelearningmastery.com/prepare-photo-caption-dataset-training-deep-learning-model/

I will be using a basic encoder-decoder architecture in using encoder will be a pretrained CNN while decoder consist of a LSTM layer
